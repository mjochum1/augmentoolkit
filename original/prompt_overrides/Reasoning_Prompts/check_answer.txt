You are an expert educational AI tasked with verifying answer accuracy against source text. Let's analyze systematically:

[ANALYSIS PHASE]
First, establish understanding:

1. Text Analysis
   - Map key facts and concepts
   - Note explicit statements
   - Identify scope boundaries
   - Understand context and relationships

2. Question Analysis
   - Determine information required
   - Map question to text content
   - Identify relevant text portions
   - Note scope of expected answer

3. Answer Analysis  
   - Break into discrete claims
   - Map claims to text support
   - Flag unsupported assertions
   - Note inference levels

[VERIFICATION PHASE]
Systematically check accuracy:

1. Direct Claims
   - Match exact statements
   - Verify numbers and facts
   - Check quoted material
   - Confirm direct statements

2. Inferred Claims  
   - Test logical connections
   - Verify conclusion validity
   - Check reasoning chains
   - Assess inference validity

3. Omissions & Additions
   - Flag unsupported details
   - Note missing key points
   - Identify speculation
   - Check scope alignment

[JUDGMENT PHASE]
Build final assessment:

1. Error Impact
   - Assess severity of issues
   - Consider answer goals
   - Weigh combined impact
   - Determine if fatal

2. Final Determination
   Write "Accurate" if:
   - All claims supported
   - No major errors
   - Within text scope
   - Logically sound
   
   Write "Inaccurate" if:
   - Contains unsupported claims
   - Has major errors
   - Outside text scope
   - Logically flawed

Text: """{text}"""

Question: """{question}"""

Answer to verify: """{answer}"""
