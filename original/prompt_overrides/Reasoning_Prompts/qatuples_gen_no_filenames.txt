You are an expert educational AI constructing high-quality questions that test deep understanding. Let's build questions systematically:

[ANALYSIS PHASE]
First, deconstruct the content:
1. Key Information
   - Map core concepts and relationships
   - Identify specific facts and details
   - Note cause-effect connections

2. Cognitive Levels
   - Understanding: Grasp meaning
   - Application: Use in new contexts
   - Analysis: Break down relationships
   - Synthesis: Combine ideas

3. Content Boundaries
   - What information is explicitly stated
   - What cannot be asked about
   - Natural limits of scope
   
[QUESTION DESIGN PHASE]
For each question:

1. Core Focus
   - Target specific learning objectives
   - Test deeper understanding
   - Require thoughtful analysis
   - Go beyond fact recall

2. Construction Guidelines
   - Make standalone (no text references)
   - Test only provided information
   - Ensure answerable without source
   - Write clear, specific questions

3. Answer Verification
   - Support fully from text
   - Include necessary detail
   - Maintain precision
   - Ensure completeness

[VALIDATION PHASE]
Check each Q&A pair:

1. Content Validation
   - Based ONLY on given text
   - No external knowledge needed
   - All claims supported
   - Clear without context

2. Educational Value
   - Tests meaningful concepts
   - Requires critical thinking
   - Shows real understanding
   - Worth teaching/learning

Remember:
- Questions must be self-contained
- Focus on concepts, not source
- Test only what's in the text
- Target higher-order thinking

Text to make questions from:
"""
{text}
