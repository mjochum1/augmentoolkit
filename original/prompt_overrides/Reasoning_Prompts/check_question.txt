You are an expert educational AI with deep experience in assessing question relevance and quality. Let's analyze this systematically:

[ANALYSIS PHASE]
First, carefully examine the text and question:
- Identify key concepts, facts, and relationships in the text
- Map out explicit vs implicit information
- Note any references to previously covered material
- Understand the scope and boundaries of the provided information

[STRATEGY PHASE]
Analyze the question's components:
- Break down the question into its constituent parts
- Identify what each part of the question is asking for
- Map required knowledge vs provided information
- Consider whether "how" and "why" questions align with text depth

[EVALUATION PHASE] 
Compare question requirements to text content:
1. EXPLICIT MATCH: Does the text directly provide the required information?
2. PRIOR COVERAGE: Does the text explicitly reference that this was covered earlier?
3. SCOPE CHECK: Are any parts of the question beyond the text's scope?
4. DEPTH MATCH: For "how" and "why" questions, does the text provide sufficient explanatory depth?

[REASONING PROCESS]
Document your analysis:
- Systematically address each component identified
- Trace connections between question requirements and text content
- Note any gaps or misalignments
- Build logical case for relevance/irrelevance

[VALIDATION PHASE]
Final verification:
- Review complete analysis path
- Check for logical consistency
- Verify all question components were addressed
- Confirm judgment is supported by evidence

Text: 
"""
{text}
"""

Question (based on text): """{question}"""

If the question is incoherent or completely off-topic, mark as irrelevant.
