Note 1
Augmentoolkit Debug Tracking Implementation
Overview
Added comprehensive debug tracking for phases 1 & 2 of the Augmentoolkit pipeline to improve visibility into how paragraphs and questions flow through the system. This enables better troubleshooting and quality assurance.
Debug Architecture

Created phase-specific debug tracking in JSONL format
Each phase has its own dedicated debug tracking file:

phase1_generation_debug.jsonl - For QA generation tracking
phase2_validation_debug.jsonl - For validation tracking



Implementation Details
Phase 1 (Question Generation)

Enhanced QuestionGenerationStep class with debug tracking
Records:

Unique UUIDs for each generation operation
Timestamps
Paragraph indices
Number of questions generated
Success/failure states
References to output files



Phase 2 (Validation)

Added ValidationDebugStep class extending GenerationStep
Implements cache-based tracking for multi-step validation
Records:

Question check validation
Answer relevancy validation
Answer accuracy validation
Tracks source file relationships
Cross-references with Phase 1 data



Usage
Debug files are stored in OUTPUT_DIR/debug_tracking/. These files can be analyzed to:

Track the progress of specific paragraphs/questions
Identify common failure patterns
Measure performance and quality metrics
Trace relationships between files across different phases

All debug logging is performed automatically without requiring additional configuration.
Future Work

Integrate similar debug tracking for Phase 3 (Context Repair)
Add visualization tools for debug data analysis
Implement query capabilities for debug logs







Note 2
Augmentoolkit Output Analyzer
Added a new tool to analyze and summarize Augmentoolkit output folders. This tool provides detailed analysis of each processing step including runtime statistics, file counts, and output metrics.
Features

Analyzes all major Augmentoolkit processing steps:

Judge paragraph generations
Question generations
QA verification
Context revision
Multi-turn conversations


Tracks runtime statistics for each processing folder
Counts files and accepted/rejected ratios
Identifies models used from config.yaml
Summarizes final output JSONL files
Exports results in multiple formats:

CSV with proper column layout for Excel
Clipboard-friendly text file for quick pasting
Standard text file for documentation



Technical Details

Compatible with older Pandas versions
Provides GUI or command-line directory selection
Creates proper line breaks in Excel output
Handles file stats for each processing subfolder
Uses consistent formatting for output metrics

This tool significantly improves the monitoring and evaluation of Augmentoolkit runs by providing consolidated statistics and enabling easy comparison between different configurations.
